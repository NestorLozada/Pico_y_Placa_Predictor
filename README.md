# Pico y Placa Predictor
## This project tries to resolve the next problem
Using the language you feel most proficient in, we'd like you to write a "Pico y Placa" predictor in any platform you prefer (web, console, Windows, etc.). The inputs should be a license plate number (the whole number, not the last digit. e.g., PBX-1234), a date (as a String), and a time. Feel free to choose the date/time format you're comfortable with. The program should return whether or not that car can be on the road.
